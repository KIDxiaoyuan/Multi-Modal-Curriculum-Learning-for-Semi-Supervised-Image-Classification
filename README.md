  use two veiws: text and img feature
  
  The original paper used three modalities for label classification, and the accuracy rate reached more than 98% at a label rate of 50% for200samples.
This code is modified for two modalities. There may be errors. The accuracy rate is more than 75% under the label rate of 5% for 1000 samples.
It is recommended to standardize the features before replacing them.
If you have any questions about the algorithm, please contact the original author for consultation

The detailed data set description will be added later.
Problems with the current code Regarding the large-scale sample data set that cannot be created, we have a solution to the problem, but it has not been made public yet.
Please continue to pay attention to subsequent updates.
  
  原来的论文中使用了三种模态进行标签分类 在200个样本50%的标签率下准确率达到了98%以上
本代码修改为了两种模态 可能存在错误 在1000个样本5%的标签率下准确率达到了75%以上
建议在替换特征前对特征进行标准化处理。

详细的数据集说明将在之后添加。
当前代码存在的问题 对于大规模样本的数据集无法被创建，我们已经针对改问题有相关解决方案，但还未公开。
请继续关注后续的更新。
